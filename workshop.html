    <h2>Short Event Description</h2>
    <p>
        This workshop explores the innovative use of haptic feedback and sensory exploration in educational robotics.
        Focusing on vibration modules integrated into circular robotic platforms, participants will delve into how tactile
        sensations can enhance learning experiences and engagement in STEM education. The workshop will provide hands-on
        opportunities to program and experiment with haptic technologies, fostering an understanding of how sensory feedback
        can be leveraged to improve comprehension of complex concepts, facilitate inclusive education, and stimulate interest
        in robotics among diverse student populations.
    </p>

    <h2>Detailed Event Description</h2>
    <p>
        The integration of haptic feedback in educational robotics offers a unique avenue for enhancing sensory engagement
        and making abstract concepts tangible for learners. This workshop aims to bring together educators, researchers,
        and practitioners to explore the potentials of using vibration modules in circular robots as tools for teaching and learning.
